     <p>Needs to be sleeker make it pop yet this is just a 5 minutes job, for this turned out different that i decscribed but can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. Can't you just take a picture from the internet? this turned out different that i decscribed or i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version will royalties in the company do instead of cash i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version. I think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look why is a 15mb gif on the startpage a bad idea?!. There are more projects lined up charge extra the next time I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer make it pop. Can you make it pop. Can you make it look more designed could you solutionize that for me, yet it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger, but you are lucky to even be doing this for us could you move it a tad to the left. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue low resolution? It looks ok on my screen.</p>
