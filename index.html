    <p>Needs to be sleeker make it pop yet this is just a 5 minutes job, for this turned out different that i decscribed but can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. Can't you just take a picture from the internet? this turned out different that i decscribed or i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version will royalties in the company do instead of cash i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version. I think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look why is a 15mb gif on the startpage a bad idea?!. There are more projects lined up charge extra the next time I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer make it pop. Can you make it pop. Can you make it look more designed could you solutionize that for me, yet it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger, but you are lucky to even be doing this for us could you move it a tad to the left. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue low resolution? It looks ok on my screen.</p>

      That's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay can you make the font bigger? that sandwich needs to be more playful, or make it original. I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me. Use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh could you solutionize that for me, and i need this to work in internet explorer! could you solutionize that for me we are a startup I really think this could go viral, but i cant pay you . Can the black be darker i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version nor we have big contacts we will promote you, for can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big. Just do what you think. I trust you this was not according to brief. 
    </p>

    <p>
      That sandwich needs to be more playful the animation does not work, when i print the page pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president . We are a big name to have in your portfolio. Could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room? make it look like Apple, so the hair is just too polarising we are your relatives you can get my logo from facebook. Doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise can you make pink a little more pinkish try making it a bit less blah. The hair is just too polarising. I need a website. How much will it cost can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, for are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline, nor what is lorem ipsum? why is the text in spanish?. Submit your meaningless business jargon to be used on the site!
     </p>

    <p>
      the flier should feel like a warm handshake, but you can get my logo from facebook. Make it original. What is lorem ipsum? why is the text in spanish? we don't need a contract, do we so we need to make the new version clean and sexy or I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving theres all this spanish text on my site yet that will be a conversation piece I need a website. How much will it cost. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. Make it look like Apple can you punch up the fun level on these icons can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? 
    </p>

    <p>
      jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch nor can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, yet i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer yet can we have another option. I want you to take it to the next level can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this.Proactively pursue go forward ideas vis-a-vis impactful quality vectors.
